      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">How It Started</h2>
      <p class="text-blue-100/80 leading-relaxed">
        PKPL began as a small community of passionate players who wanted to bring structure, competition, and professionalism to Pakistan’s Pro Clubs scene. The founders had been part of the FIFA world for years — competing in online tournaments, playing Ultimate Team, and grinding through countless Pro Clubs seasons long before PKPL existed. What started as a casual idea between experienced players quickly evolved into a vision: a proper league system for the Pakistani community. 
        Inspired by platforms like VPG and driven by an overwhelming community response, the project grew far beyond expectations. Friendly matches turned into organised fixtures, casual squads became dedicated clubs, and a handful of players expanded into a thriving community of over 100 active competitors. With each season, PKPL introduced better structure, stronger competition, and increasingly exciting prize pools — transforming a simple idea into one of the most recognised Pro Clubs leagues in the region.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">The Rise of PPL</h2>
      <p class="text-blue-100/80 leading-relaxed">
        In just a few months, PPL has grown into a multi‑season competition featuring talented clubs from
        across the Pakistani community worldwide. Each season brings new rivalries, new stories, and
        unforgettable moments. The community is growing with active feedback, and improvement in structure, viewership, participation, competition and tactics.

        
        OUR VISION: To provide a platform for Pakistani FIFA players to compete in professional pro clubs competition.
